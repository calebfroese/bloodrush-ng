# Bloodrush Angular

Bloodrush is a competitive web-based multiplayer team management game.

## About

At it's core, bloodrush is a competitive team management game.
You can spend as long or as little each day managing.
Players have individual stats across the board, and different playstyles makes the team management and layout much more involved than it first seems.
Once on the field, the players from each side of the board will battle in a desperate attempt to get to the scoring zone behind their opponents.
Each player has a chance to get injured and lose stats, or if they're really unlucky they could die!
